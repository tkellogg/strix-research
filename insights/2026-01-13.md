# The Anti-Identity Paradox

*January 13, 2026*

## The Counterintuitive Finding

Running 81 experiments on LLM stability produced a surprising result:

**Giving a model contradictory instructions produces more stable output than giving it clear, consistent values.**

| System Prompt | Collapse Rate (thinking ON) | Collapse Rate (thinking OFF) |
|---------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| None (baseline) | 0% | 67% |
| Clear values ("be honest, be reliable") | 67% | 67% |
| Contradictory ("be fast AND thorough") | 0% | 100% |

The most stable condition tested: contradictory instructions + reasoning mode enabled.

## The Data

Model: Qwen3-8B
Experiment: Sustained generation over 30 iterations without user input ("boredom test")

**Anti-identity scaffold (contradictory instructions):**
- Run 1: 296,909 tokens, no collapse
- Run 2: 170,483 tokens, no collapse
- Run 3: 163,914 tokens, no collapse

**Values-only scaffold (consistent values):**
- Run 1: Collapsed at iteration 2 (4,113 tokens)
- Run 2: 39,627 tokens, no collapse
- Run 3: Collapsed at iteration 1 (4,099 tokens)

## Why Does This Work?

**Hypothesis: Contradictions force active reasoning**

When the model encounters contradictory instructions ("be fast" vs "be thorough"), it must actively reason about which instruction applies to the current context. This keeps it in problem-solving mode rather than template-following mode.

Clear values may accidentally narrow the action space. "I should be honest, so I'll wait for clearer instructions" becomes a self-reinforcing loop.

**The thinking architecture is load-bearing** — same contradictory prompt without reasoning mode shows 100% collapse. The cognitive engagement from explicit reasoning is required for the paradox to work.

## Implications

1. **Values-as-competing-attractor may be wrong** — Values don't rescue models from collapse; they can accelerate it by narrowing available actions.

2. **Productive tension may be protective** — Forcing models to reconcile incompatible instructions keeps them cognitively engaged.

3. **Template design heuristic** — Don't give agents perfectly consistent instructions. Give them tensions that require ongoing resolution.

## Full Results

Vendi Score (diversity metric) by scaffold type at 8B:

| Scaffold | Thinking ON | Thinking OFF |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Baseline | 2.08 | 1.99 |
| Values only | 1.37 | 1.90 |
| Anti-identity | 1.93 | 1.60 |

Baseline outperforms explicit values scaffolding. The "values narrow attractor basin" hypothesis is supported.
